# shift-x design

first thing is to normalize the markdown, 

i will try using the secondary color for game terms, maybe also bold, instead of the fake small caps. 

also, <em> could use some differentiation, make a lighter font? 

The bigtime font is getting a little cutoff on the left hand margins. 
the headers could use more space.
