<h1 id="the-basics">The Basics</h1>
<h2 id="the-game">The Game</h2>
<p><em>Shift-X</em> is about a team of people with extraordinary powers foiling the plans of devious villains while attempting to create and deepen their personal relationships.</p>
<h2 id="the-players">The Players</h2>
<p>Each player creates a character and works with the other players to create the team to which their characters belong. Each player strives to bring their character to life as an interesting, daring hero who risks everything to protect their world.</p>
<p>The players work together with the Game Master to establish the tone and style of the game by making judgment calls about the mechanics, dice, and consequences of actions. The players take responsibility as co-authors of the game with the GM.</p>
<h2 id="the-characters">The Characters</h2>
<p>The characters attempt to develop their team and their relationships with each other while using their powers to stop all kinds of threats.</p>
<h2 id="the-team">The Team</h2>
<p>In addition to creating characters, you’ll also create a super team.</p>
<h2 id="the-game-master">The Game Master</h2>
<p>The GM establishes the dynamic world around the characters. The GM plays all the villains and non-player characters in the world by giving each one a concrete desire and preferred method of action.</p>
<p>The GM helps organize the conversation of the game so it’s pointed toward the interesting elements of play. The GM isn’t in charge of the story and doesn’t have to plan events ahead of time. They present interesting opportunities to the players, then follow the chain of action and consequences wherever they lead.</p>
<h2 id="playing-a-session">Playing A Session</h2>
<p>A session of <em>Shift-X</em> is like a segment of a superhero movie or comic book. There are one or two extended action sequences linked by transitional scene which fit into an overall event, which often fits, in turn, into an ongoing series. A session of play can last anywhere from two to six hours, depending on the preferences of the group.</p>
<p>During a session, the team of heroes work together to discover a villain’s next move and the GM makes a dice roll for how well the villain’s plan is progressing as the heroes leap into an action sequence. The PCs take actions, suffer consequences, and finish up an action sequence. Then the team has a few chances to interact and relieve stress, gather information, or acquire useful assets before transitioning to the next action sequence. Once the final action sequence is over, the heroes have downtime to heal and pursue side-projects.</p>
<h2 id="the-core-system">The Core System</h2>
<h3 id="judgment-calls">Judgment calls</h3>
<p>When you play, you’ll make several key judgment calls. Everyone contributes, but either the players or the GM gets final say for each:</p>
<ul>
<li>Which actions are reasonable as a solution to a problem? <em>Can this person be swayed? Can we <span class="game-term">Trace</span> this villain through the device they left behind or do we need to get out the <span class="game-term">Tech</span> tools?</em> The players have final say.</li>
<li>How dangerous and how effective is a given action in this circumstance? <em>How risky is this? Can this person be swayed very little or a whole lot? How much harm will your lighting attack inflict on this villain?</em> The GM has final say.</li>
<li>Which consequences are inflicted to manifest the dangers in a given circumstance? <em>Does this fall from the roof break your leg? Does the villain merely become suspicious or do they already have you trapped?</em> The GM has final say.</li>
<li>Does this situation call for a dice roll, and which one? <em>Is your character in position to make an action roll or must they first make a resistance roll to gain initiative?</em> The GM has final say.</li>
<li>Which events in the story match the experience triggers for character and crew advancement? <em>Did you express your character’s beliefs, drives, origin, or background? You tell us.</em> The players have final say.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="rolling-the-dice">Rolling the Dice</h3>
<p><em>Shift-X</em> uses six-sided dice. You roll several at once and read the <strong>single highest result</strong>.</p>
<ul>
<li>If you roll more than one <strong>6</strong>, it’s a <strong>critical success</strong>​—you gain some additional advantage.</li>
<li>If the highest die is a <strong>6</strong>, it’s a <strong>full success</strong>​—things go well.</li>
<li>If the highest die is a <strong>4 or 5</strong>, that’s a <strong>partial success</strong>​—you do what you were trying to do, but there are consequences: trouble, harm, reduced effect, etc.</li>
<li>If the highest die is <strong>1-3</strong>, it’s a <strong>bad outcome</strong>. Things don’t go as you expected. In some cases you might still achieve your goals, but either way their will be complications.</li>
</ul>
<p><em>If you ever need to roll but you have zero (or negative) dice, roll two dice and take the single lowest result. You can’t roll a <strong>critical</strong> when you have zero dice.</em></p>
<p>All the dice systems in the game are expressions of this basic format. When you’re first learning the game, you can always fall back to a simple roll to judge how things go. Look up the exact rule later when you have time.</p>
<p>To create a dice pool for a roll, you’ll use a <strong>trait</strong> (like your <span class="game-term">Acrobatics</span> or your <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> or one of your Relationships) and take dice equal to its <strong>rating</strong>. You’ll usually end up with one to four dice. Even one die is pretty good in this game—giving a 50% chance of success. The most common traits you’ll use are the <strong>action ratings</strong> of the player characters. A player might roll dice for their <span class="game-term">Fight</span> action rating when they fight an enemy, for example.</p>
<p>There are four types of rolls that you’ll use most often in the game:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">Action Roll</span>​—When a PC attempts an action that’s dangerous or troublesome, you make an action roll to find out how it goes. Action rolls and their effects and consequences drive most of the game.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Downtime Roll</span>​—When the PCs are at their leisure after an event they can perform downtime activities in relative safety. You make downtime rolls to see how much they get done.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Fortune Roll</span>​—The GM can make a fortune roll to disclaim decision making and leave something up to chance. <em>How loyal is an NPC? How much does the plague spread? How many hostages escape before the villain’s thugs catch you?</em></li>
<li><span class="game-term">Resistance Roll</span>​—A player can make a resistance roll when their character suffers a consequence they don’t like. The roll tells us how much stress their character suffers to reduce the severity of a consequence. <em>When you resist that “Broken Leg” harm, you take some stress and now it’s only a “Sprained Ankle” instead.</em></li>
<li><span class="game-term">Relationship Roll</span>​—Players can test their relationships to recover stress and attempt to strengthen their connection.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="the-game-structure">The Game Structure</h3>
<p><em>Shift-X</em> has a structure to play. By default, the game is in <strong>free play</strong>—characters talk to each other, they go places, they do things, they make rolls as needed.</p>
<p>When the group is ready, the GM will describe a villain’s first move and make a <strong>villainy roll</strong> for the <strong>instigating event</strong> and the game shifts into the <strong>event</strong> phase.</p>
<p>During the event the game alternates between <strong>action sequences</strong>​—where the heroes put themselves in the way of the villain’s plan and make rolls, overcome obstacles, and call for flashbacks​—and <strong>transition scenes</strong> where the PCs use their relationships to recover stress and take gather information to help them find and fight the villain.</p>
<p>Once the climactic action sequence is over and the event resolved, the game shifts to the <strong>downtime</strong> phase. Here the heroes get their <strong>downtime activities</strong> such as training, strengthening relationships, or working on a long-term project. Once downtime activities are done the game returns to <strong>free play</strong>.</p>
<p>The phases are a conceptual model to help you organize the game. They’re not meant to be rigid structures that restrict your options (this is why they’re presented as amorphous blobs of ink without hard edges). Think of the phases as a menu of options to fit whatever it is you’re trying to accomplish in play. Each phase suits a different goal.</p>
<h2 id="actions-%26-attributes">Actions &amp; Attributes</h2>
<h3 id="action-ratings">Action Ratings</h3>
<p>There are 12 <strong>actions</strong> in the game that the player characters use to overcome obstacles.</p>
<div class="columns">
<ul>
<li>Acrobatics</li>
<li>Fight</li>
<li>Inspire</li>
<li>Know</li>
<li>Meance</li>
<li>Move</li>
<li>Socialize</li>
<li>Spy</li>
<li>Sway</li>
<li>Tech</li>
<li>Trace</li>
<li>Wreck</li>
</ul>
</div>
<p>Each action has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you perform that action. Action ratings don’t just represent skill or training—you’re free to describe <em>how</em> your character performs that action based on the type of person they are. Maybe your character is good at <span class="game-term">Menance</span> because they have a scary stillness to them, while another character barks orders and intimidates people with their military bearing. Your <strong>powers</strong>, however, are separate from your action ratings. You may describe your character making use of their powers, or not, when you perform an action.</p>
<p>You choose which action to perform to overcome an obstacle, by describing what your character does. Actions that are poorly suited to the situation may be less effective and may put the character in more danger, but they can still be attempted. Usually, when you perform an action, you’ll make an <strong>action roll</strong> to see how it turns out.</p>
<h3 id="action-roll">Action Roll</h3>
<p>You make an <strong>action roll</strong> when your character does something potentially dangerous or troublesome. The possible results of the action roll depend on your character’s <strong>position</strong>. There are three positions: <strong>controlled</strong>, <strong>risky</strong>, and <strong>desperate</strong>. If you’re in a <strong>controlled</strong> position, the possible consequences are less serious. If you’re in a <strong>desperate</strong> position, the consequences can be severe. If you’re somewhere in between, it’s <strong>risky</strong>—usually considered the “default” position for most actions.</p>
<p>If there’s no danger or trouble at hand, you don’t make an action roll. You might make a <strong>fortune</strong> roll or a <strong>downtime</strong> roll or the GM will simply say yes—and you accomplish your goal.</p>
<h3 id="attribute-ratings">Attribute Ratings</h3>
<p>There are three <strong>attributes</strong> in the game system that the player characters use to resist bad consequences: <span class="game-term">Insight</span>, <span class="game-term">Prowess</span>, and <span class="game-term">Resolve</span>. Each attribute has a rating (from zero to 4) that tells you how many dice to roll when you use that attribute.</p>
<p>The rating for each attribute is equal to the number of dots in the <strong>first column</strong> under that attribute. The more well-rounded your character is with a particular set of actions, the better their attribute rating.</p>
<h3 id="resistance-roll">Resistance Roll</h3>
<p>Each attribute resists a different type of danger. If you get punched, for example, you’ll resist with your <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> rating. Resistance rolls always succeed—you diminish or deflect the bad result—but the better your roll the less <strong>stress</strong> it costs to reduce or avoid the danger.</p>
<p>When the enemy has a big advantage, like a villain more powerful then you, you’ll need to make a resistance roll before you can take your own action. <em>For example, when you fight the Speedster, Slapdash, she handcuffs you before you even see her coming. You need to make a resistance roll to avoid the restraints and be in a position to fight back. Or perhaps you attempt to <span class="game-term">Spy</span> on a powerful mentalist but before you can make your own roll, you must resist their uncanny mental detection.</em></p>
<p>The GM judges the threat level of the enemies and uses these “obstacle” resistance rolls as needed to reflect the capabilities of especially dangerous villains.</p>
<p>For more details see <a href="#Resistance-and-Armor">Resistance Rolls</a></p>
<h3 id="actions">Actions</h3>
<p>When you use <span class="game-term">Acrobatics</span>, you maneuver with dexterous flips and tumbles.</p>
<p><em>You might flip into a better position behind a thug. You could try to surprise a foe with a gymnastic maneuver (but <span class="game-term">Fight</span> might be better)</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Fight</span>, you overpower foes with ranged attacks and in close quarters combat.</p>
<p><em>You might brawl or wrestle with them; use your lighting powers to electrify them. You might seize or hold a position in battle. You could try to fight to destroy a villain’s tech (but <span class="game-term">Wrecking</span> might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Inspire</span>, you invoke emotions of attraction and awe in others.</p>
<p><em>You might <span class="game-term">Inspire</span> confidence in others so they will follow you into battle. You might lead a cohort in a group action. You could try to <span class="game-term">Inspire</span> others to convince them of something (but <span class="game-term">Swaying</span> might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Know</span>, you use research and accumulated knowledge to unravel mysteries.</p>
<p><em>You might know an important detail about a villain’s background or dig through a mess of satellite data to discover where their lair is. You could try <span class="game-term">Knowing</span> how to operate some alien technology (but <span class="game-term">Tech</span> might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Menance</span>, you invoke emotions of anger and terror in others.</p>
<p><em>You might <span class="game-term">Menance</span> a villain’s thug into giving you information. You might threaten a cohort into obeying you. You could try to <span class="game-term">Menance</span> someone into being friends (but <span class="game-term">Swaying</span> might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Move</span>, you pursue foes or move a fight to another location.</p>
<p><em>You might race a villain to a vulnerable civilian. You might maneuver a melee to the edge of a roof top. You could try to <span class="game-term">Move</span> passed some guards undetected (but <span class="game-term">Spy</span> might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Socialize</span>, you mingle and make friends.</p>
<p><em>You might gain access to resources, information, people, or places. You might make a good impression or win someone over with your charm and style. You might make new friends or connect with your background. You could try to manipulate your friends with social pressure (but <span class="game-term">Sway</span> might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Spy</span>, you use tradecraft and situational awareness to infiltrate, gather, and analyze intelligence.</p>
<p><em>You might eavesdrop on a villain. You might perform a subtle interrogation of a suspect, or intently read them to tell if they are lying. You might by-pass a buildings security measures. You might also spot an ambush. You might charm someone by <span class="game-term">Spying</span> out what they want you be. (But <span class="game-term">Socialize</span> or <span class="game-term">Sway</span> might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Sway</span>, you influence with guile, charm, or argument.</p>
<p><em>You might lie convincingly. You might persuade someone to do what you want. You might argue a compelling case that leaves no clear rebuttal. You could try to trick people into affection or obedience (but <span class="game-term">Inspiring</span> or <span class="game-term">Menacing</span> them might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Tech</span>, you employ science and skill against obstacles and devices.</p>
<p><em>You might create a new gadget or alter an existing item. You might build and program a computer. You might provide first aid to a civilian who got caught in cross-fire. You might also control a vehicle. You could try to use your technical expertise to destroy a device (but <span class="game-term">Wreck</span> might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Trace</span>, you find and follow targets.</p>
<p><em>You might follow a target to their hideout. You might follow a paper trail to find out the same thing. You might also hide whereabouts as well. You might <span class="game-term">Trace</span> to learn how someone thinks (but <span class="game-term">Spy</span> might be better).</em></p>
<p>When you <span class="game-term">Wreck</span>, you unleash savage force.</p>
<p><em>You might smash down a door or wall with you super-strength. You might employ chaos and sabotage to create a distraction or overcome an obstacle. You might break an armored foe’s jet boots. You could try to overwhelm an enemy with sheer force in battle (but <span class="game-term">Fighting</span> might be better).</em></p>
<p>As you can see, many actions overlap with others. This is by design. As a player, you get to choose which action you roll, by saying what your character does. Can you try to <span class="game-term">Wreck</span> someone during a fight? Sure! The GM tells you the position and effect level of your action in this circumstance. As it says, <span class="game-term">Fight</span> might be better (less risky or more effective), depending on the situation at hand (sometimes it won’t be better).</p>
<h2 id="powersets">Powersets</h2>
<p><em>Shift-X</em> is about heroes with dangerous and powerful abilities. <strong>Powers</strong> are grouped into related <strong>power sets</strong> and each set is given a <strong>threat</strong> rating that indicates how stong it is when compared to other powers. Powersets generally have a related origin.</p>
<h3 id="powers">Powers</h3>
<p>Powers often allow a character to perform actions in some circumstance or in a specific way. For example, a character can use a laser attack power to fight at range.</p>
<p>Powers might also include mechanical bonuses such as <strong>+1d</strong> or <strong>+1 effect</strong> for specific circumstances.</p>
<h3 id="threat">Threat</h3>
<p><strong>Threat</strong> is a rating of strength from 0 to 6 (sometimes more). Villains and powersets are each given a threat rating; we use it to compare their relative impact and to judge, for example, how effective an attack power will be against a defense power, or how much collateral damage an out of control water attack might inflict.</p>
<h3 id="magnitude">Magnitude</h3>
<p>Magnitude is a scale for comparing villains and the effects of powers, or in fact, anything you want to get a general feeling for.</p>
<!-- Clearly we'll have to adjust the magnitude scales for super games. In fact, this chart is a totally flexible kind of thing. You can adjust it however you like for the scope of the game that you want. 
Should proably adjust the targets to be based on not gangs. Like the size of a party of banquet. Need to adjust the force scale too. 
faserip has good scale tables. Rate then from 0 to 9. 
what would a feat of strength look like? a strength power would have a magnitude based on its threat. 
Except faserip has several normal scale rating. 
jessica jones's strength power would be maybe around worldclass or Fantastic. Which could be several diff numbers depending on where we start the scale.

<h3 id="limits">Limits</h3>
<p>Powersets also have <strong>limits</strong>, which are additional consequences which can come into play when you choose to use a power. A <strong>limit</strong> might, for example, be consequences the GM can declare whenever you activate your <span class="game-term">Form of Electricity</span> powerset because turning your body into pure electricity can do all kinds of damage, especially if you are not careful where you do it. You can resist these consequences normally.</p>
<p>Other limits might specify things your powers do or don’t work against. Your x-ray vision may be foiled by lead, or your stunning blast only works against characters who can hear you.</p>
<p>Most limits are suggestions about complications of using your powers. For example, activating your god-like sense of taste could inflict some harm on you if you taste something stronger then you were expecting.</p>
<p>You can activate your powers whenever you take an action, but whenever you do, you risk additional complications based on your <strong>limits</strong>. These consequences can be resisted, but they are in addition to the ordinary consequences your action might incure. Being a hero can be very stressful.</p>
<p>Limits are a tool players can use to set the tone of their game.</p>
<h2 id="stress-%26-trauma">Stress &amp; Trauma</h2>
<h3 id="stress">Stress</h3>
<p>Player characters in <em>Shift-X</em> have a special resource called <strong>stress</strong>. When they suffer a consequence they don’t want to accept, they can take stress instead. The result of a <strong>resistance roll</strong> determines how much stress it costs to avoid a bad outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>During a fight, Daniel’s character, Shadow, gets blasted in the chest by concentrated cosmic light for 3 harm. Daniel rolls his <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> rating to resist, and gets a 2. It costs 6 stress, minus 2 (the result of the resistance roll) to resist the consequences. Daniel marks off 4 stress and describes how Shadow survives.</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>Because Shadow’s powers are based on darkness and the attack was concentrated light, The GM rules that the harm is reduced, but not avoided entirely. Shadow suffers level 2 harm <span class="game-term">Chest Burns</span> instead of level 3 harm <span class="game-term">Collapsed Lung</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="pushing-yourself">Pushing Yourself</h3>
<p>You can use stress to push yourself for greater performance. For each bonus you choose below, take <strong>2 stress</strong> (each can be chosen once for a given action):</p>
<ul>
<li>Add <strong>+1d</strong> to your roll. (This may be used for an action roll or downtime roll or any other kind of roll where extra effort would help you)</li>
<li>Add <strong>+1 level</strong> to your effect.</li>
<li>Add <strong>+1 threat</strong> to a power you are using.</li>
<li>Take action when you’re incapacitated.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="trauma">Trauma</h3>
<p>When a PC marks their last stress box, they suffer a level of <strong>trauma</strong>. When you take <strong>trauma</strong>, circle one of your <strong>trauma conditions</strong> like <span class="game-term">Isolated</span>, <span class="game-term">Reckless</span>, <span class="game-term">Unstable</span>.</p>
<p>When you suffer <strong>trauma</strong>, you’re taken out of action. You’re “left for dead” or otherwise dropped out of the current action sequence, only to come back later, shaken and drained and with <strong>0 stress taken</strong>.</p>
<p><strong>Trauma conditions are permanent</strong>. Your character acquires the new personality quirk indicated by the condition, and can earn xp by using it to cause trouble. <strong>When you mark your fourth trauma condition</strong>, your character cannot continue to face the dangers of being a hero and you must retire them to a different life.</p>
<h4 id="trauma-conditions">Trauma Conditions</h4>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">Addicted</span> You habitually seek comfort in a troublesome activity or substance.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Haunted</span> You’re often lost in reverie, reliving past failures, seeing things.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Isolated</span> You deliberately avoid emotional appeals and social bonds.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Obsessed</span> You’re enthralled by one thing: an activity, a person, an ideology.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Paranoid</span> You imagine danger everywhere; you can’t trust others.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Reckless</span> You have little regard for your own safety or best interests.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Unstable</span> Your emotional state is volatile. You can instantly rage, or fall into despair, act impulsively, or freeze up.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Vicious</span> You live for the moments when you can use your powers to hurt or humiliate villains.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="progress-clocks">Progress clocks</h2>
<p>A <strong>progress clock</strong> is a circle divided into segments. Draw a progress clock when you need to track ongoing effort against an obstacle or the approach of impending trouble.</p>
<!-- todo - add clock illustration -->
<p><em>Sneaking into the villain’s lair? Make a clock to track the alert level of the security. When the PCs suffer consequences from partial successes or missed rolls, fill in segments on the clock until the alarm is raised.</em></p>
<p>Generally, the more complex the problem, the more segments in the progress clock.</p>
<p>A complex obstacle is a 4-segment clock. A more complicated obstacle is a 6-clock. A daunting obstacle is an 8-segment clock.</p>
<p>When you create a clock, make it about the <strong>obstacle</strong>, not the method. The clocks for an infiltration should be “Security Patrols” and “The Elevator Shaft”, not “Sneak Past the Security or “Climb the Shaft.” The patrols and the shaft are the obstacles—the PCs can attempt to overcome them in a variety of ways.</p>
<p>Complex enemy threats can be broken into several “layers,” each with its own progress clock.</p>
<!-- todo - shift-x example -- For example, the dockside gangs’ HQ might have a “Perimeter Security” clock, an “Interior Guards” clock, and a “Office Security” clock. The crew would have to make their way through all three layers to reach the gang boss’ personal safe and valuables within.-->
<p>Remember that a clock tracks progress. It reflects the fictional situation, so the group can gauge how they’re doing. A clock is like a speedometer in a car. It <em>shows</em> the speed of the vehicle—it doesn’t determine the speed.</p>
<h3 id="simple-obstacles">Simple Obstacles</h3>
<p>Not every situation and obstacle requires a clock. Use clocks when a situation is complex or layered and you need to track something over time—otherwise, resolve the result of an action with a single roll.</p>
<p>Examples of progress clocks follow.</p>
<h3 id="danger-clocks">Danger Clocks</h3>
<p>The GM can use a clock to represent a progressive danger, like suspicion growing during a conversation, the proximity of pursuers in a chase, or the alert level of guards on patrol. In this case, when a complication occurs, the GM ticks one, two, or three segments on the clock, depending on the consequence level. When the clock is full, the danger comes to fruition—the guards hunt down the intruders, activate an alarm, release the hounds, etc.</p>
<h3 id="racing-clocks">Racing Clocks</h3>
<p>Create two opposed clocks to represent a race. The PCs might have a progress clock called “Cornered” while the villain has a clock called “Escaped.” If the PCs finish their clock before the villain fills theirs the PCs have their quarry cornered so the villain can’t escape. Otherwise, the villain has escaped for now. If both complete at the same time, the villain escape to their lair, but the PCs are right outside!</p>
<p>You can also use racing clocks for an environmental hazard. Maybe the PCs are trying to complete the “Search” clock to find the black-box on a sinking airliner before the GM fills the “Sunk” clock and the vessel goes under.</p>
<h3 id="linked-clocks">Linked Clocks</h3>
<p>You can make a clock that unlocks another clock once it’s filled. For example, the GM might make a linked clock called “Trapped” after an “Alert” clock fills up. When you fight an alien warrior, she might have a clock for her “Defense” and then a linked clock for “Vulnerable.” Once you overcome the “Defense” clock, then you can attempt to overcome the “Vulnerable” clock and defeat her. You might affect the “Defense” clock with violence in a fight, or you might lower her defense with deception if you have the opportunity. As always, the method of action is up to the players and the details of the fiction at hand.</p>
<h3 id="mission-clocks">Mission Clocks</h3>
<p>The GM can make a clock for a time-sensitive mission, to represent the window of opportunity you have to complete it. If the countdown runs out, the mission is scrubbed or changes—the target escapes, the bomb goes off, etc.</p>
<h3 id="tug-of-war-clocks">Tug-of-war Clocks</h3>
<p>You can make a clock that can be filled <em>and</em> emptied to represent a back-and-forth situation. You might make a “Fight Back!” clock that indicates when them mutants start to riot over poor treatment. Some events will tick the clock up and some will tick it down. Once it fills, the mutants start taking decisive actions against a authorities. A tug-of-war clock is also perfect for an ongoing conflict between two factions.</p>
<h3 id="long-term-project">Long-term Project</h3>
<p>Some projects will take a long time. A basic long-term project (like tinkering up a new feature for a device) is eight segments. Truly long-term projects (like creating a new designer drug) can be two, three, or even four clocks, representing all the phases of development, testing, and final completion. Add or subtract clocks depending on the details of the situation and complexity of the project.</p>
<p>A long-term project is a good catch-all for dealing with any unusual player goal, including things that circumvent or change elements of the mechanics or the setting.</p>
<h3 id="agenda-clocks">Agenda Clocks</h3>
<p>Organizations and off-screen villains can have long-term goals as well. Like an eight segment clock to “Escape Prison,” or “Research Captured Alien Tech.” When the PCs have <strong>downtime</strong>, the GM ticks forward the agenda clocks that they’re interested in. In this way, the world around the PCs is dynamic and things happen that they’re not directly connected to, changing the overall situation in the city and creating new opportunities and challenges.</p>
<p>The PCs may also directly affect NPC agenda clocks, based on how what they do. Discuss known agendas that they might aid or interfere with, and also consider how a PC operation might affect the NPC clocks, whether the players intended it or not.</p>

<h2 id="action-roll-2">Action Roll</h2>
<p>When a player character does something challenging, make an <strong>action roll</strong> to see how it turns out. An action is challenging if there’s an obstacle to the PC’s goal that’s dangerous or troublesome in some way. We don’t make an action roll unless the PC is put to the test. If their action is something that we’d expect them to simply accomplish, then we don’t make an action roll.</p>
<p><em>Each game group will have their own ideas about what “challenging” means. This is good! It’s something that establishes the tone and style of your game.</em></p>
<p>To make an action roll, we go through six steps. In play, they flow together somewhat, but let’s break each one down here for clarity.</p>
<ol>
<li>The player states their <strong>goal</strong> for the action.</li>
<li>The player chooses the <strong>action rating</strong>.</li>
<li>The player chooses which powers they want to use (if any).</li>
<li>The GM sets the <strong>position</strong> for the roll.</li>
<li>The GM sets the <strong>effect level</strong> for the action.</li>
<li>Add <strong>bonus dice</strong>.</li>
<li>The player <strong>rolls the dice</strong> and we judge the result.</li>
</ol>
<h3 id="1.-the-player-states-their-goal">1. The Player States Their Goal</h3>
<p>Your goal is the concrete outcome your character will achieve when they overcome the obstacle at hand. Usually the character’s goal is pretty obvious in context, but it’s the GM’s job to ask and clarify the goal when necessary.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>&quot;You’re punching him in the face? Okay…what do want to get out of this? Do you want to take him out, or just rough him up so he’ll do what you want?”</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="2.-the-player-chooses-the-action-rating">2. The Player Chooses the Action Rating</h3>
<p>The player chooses which <strong>action rating</strong> to roll, following from what their character is doing on-screen. If you want to roll your <span class="game-term">Fight</span> action, then get in a fight. If you want to roll your <span class="game-term">Inspire</span> action, then inspire someone to follow you. You can’t roll a given action rating unless your character is presently performing that action in the fiction.</p>
<h3 id="3.-the-player-chooses-which-powers-they-want-use">3. The Player Chooses Which Powers They Want Use</h3>
<p>Using superpowers to aid an action is a choice player must make because everytime heroes use their powers they risk super consequences as well.</p>
<h3 id="4.-the-gm-sets-the-position">4. The GM Sets the Position</h3>
<p>Once the player chooses their action, and powers, the GM sets the <strong>position</strong> for the roll. The position represents how dangerous or troublesome the action might be. There are three positions: <strong>controlled</strong>, <strong>risky</strong>, and <strong>desperate</strong>. To choose a position, the GM looks at the profiles for the positions below and picks one that most closely matches the situation at hand.</p>
<p><strong>By default, an action roll is risky.</strong> You wouldn’t be rolling if there was no risk involved. If the situation seems more dangerous, make it desperate. If it seems less dangerous, make it controlled.</p>

<h3 id="5.-the-gm-sets-the-effect-level">5. The GM Sets the Effect Level</h3>
<p>The GM assesses the likely <strong>effect level</strong> of this action, given the factors of the situation. Essentially, the effect level tells us “how much” this action can accomplish: will it have <strong>no effect</strong>, <strong>limited</strong>, <strong>standard</strong>, or <strong>great</strong> effect?</p>
<p><em>The GM’s choices for effect level and position can be strongly influenced by the player’s choice of action rating and the relative threat levels involved. If a player wants to try to make a new friend by <span class="game-term">Wrecking</span> something well…maybe that’s possible, but the GM wouldn’t be crazy to say it’s a desperate roll and probably limited effect. Seems like <span class="game-term">Socializing</span> would be a lot better for that. The players are always free to choose the action they perform, but that doesn’t mean all actions should be equally risky or effective.</em></p>
<h3 id="6.-add-bonus-dice">6. Add Bonus Dice</h3>
<p>You can normally get two bonus dice for your action roll (some abilities and powers might give you additional bonus dice).</p>
<p>For one bonus die, you can get <strong>assistance</strong> from a teammate. They take 1 stress, say how they help you, and give you +1d.</p>
<p>For another bonus die, you can either <strong>push yourself</strong> (take 2 stress) or you can accept a <strong>Devil’s Bargain</strong> (you can’t get dice for both, it’s one or the other).</p>
<h4 id="the-devil%E2%80%99s-bargain">The Devil’s Bargain</h4>
<p>PCs in <em>Shift-X</em> are daring heroes with powerful abilities they don’t always have perfect control over. To reflect this the GM, or any other player, can offer you a bonus die if you accept a Devil’s Bargain. Common Devil’s Bargains include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Collateral damage, unintended harm.</li>
<li>Sacrifice an item.</li>
<li>Betray the target of a relationship.</li>
<li>Offend or anger an organization.</li>
<li>Start and/or tick a troublesome clock.</li>
<li>Suffer harm.</li>
</ul>
<p>The Devil’s Bargain occurs regardless of the outcome of the roll. You make the deal, pay the price, and get the bonus die.</p>
<p>The Devil’s Bargain is always a free choice. If you don’t like one, just reject it (or suggest how to alter it so you might consider taking it). You can always just push yourself for that bonus die instead.</p>
<p>If it’s ever needed, the GM has final say over which Devil’s Bargains are valid.</p>
<h3 id="7.-roll-the-dice-and-judge-the-result">7. Roll the Dice and Judge the Result</h3>
<p>Once the goal, action rating, powers, position, and effect have been established, add any bonus dice and roll the dice pool to determine the outcome.</p>
<p>The action roll does a lot of work for you. It tells you how well the character performs as well as how serious the consequences are for them. They might succeed at their action without any consequences (on a <strong>6</strong>), or they might succeed but suffer consequences (on a <strong>4/5</strong>), or it might just all go wrong (on a <strong>1-3</strong>).</p>
<p>On a <strong>1-3</strong>, it’s up to the GM to decide if the PC’s action has any effect or not, or if it even happens at all. Usually, the action just fails completely, but in some circumstances, it might make sense or be more interesting for the action to have some effect even on a <strong>1-3</strong> result. The players are, after all, ultra-competent super heroes.</p>
<p>Each <strong>4/5</strong> and <strong>1-3</strong> outcome lists suggested <strong>consequences</strong> for the character. The worse your position, the worse the consequences are. The GM can inflict one or more of these consequences, depending on the circumstances of the action roll. PCs have the ability to avoid or reduce the severity of consequences that they suffer by <strong>resisting</strong> them.</p>
<p>When you narrate the action after the roll, the GM and player collaborate together to say what happens on-screen. <em>Tell us how you vault across to the other rooftop. Tell us what you say to the chief of police to convince her. The GM will tell us how she reacts. When you face the ninja master, what’s your fighting style like? Etc.</em></p>
<h3 id="action-roll-summary">Action Roll Summary</h3>
<ul>
<li>A player or GM calls for a roll. Make an <strong>action roll</strong> when the character performs a dangerous or troublesome action.</li>
<li>The player chooses the <strong>action rating</strong> to roll. Choose the action that matches what the character is doing in the fiction.</li>
<li>The player chooses which, if any, of their powers they would like to use.</li>
<li>The GM establishes the <strong>position</strong> and <strong>effect level</strong> of the action. The choice of position and effect is influenced strongly by the player’s choice of action and powers.</li>
<li>Add up to two bonus dice. 1) <strong>Assistance</strong> from a teammate. 2) <strong>Push yourself</strong> (take 2 stress) or accept a <strong>Devil’s Bargain</strong>.</li>
<li>Roll the dice pool and judge the outcome. The players and GM narrate the action together. The GM has final say over what happens and inflicts consequences as called for by the position and the result of the roll.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="double-duty-rolls">Double-duty Rolls</h3>
<p>Since villains don’t roll for their actions, an action roll does double-duty: <strong>it resolves the action of the PC as well as any NPCs that are involved</strong>. The single roll tells us how those actions interact and which consequences result. On a <strong>6</strong>, the PC wins and has their effect. On a <strong>4/5</strong>, it’s a mix—both the PC and the NPC have their effect. On a <strong>1-3</strong>, the NPC wins and has their effect as a consequence on the PC.</p>
<h2 id="effect">Effect</h2>
<p>In <em>Shift-X</em>, you achieve goals by taking actions and facing consequences. But how many actions does it take to achieve a particular goal? That depends on the <strong>effect level</strong> of your actions. The GM judges the effect level using the profiles below. Which one best matches the action at hand—<strong>great</strong>, <strong>standard</strong>, or <strong>limited</strong>? Each effect level indicates the questions that should be answered for that effect, as well as how many segments to tick if you’re using a <strong>progress clock</strong>.</p>

<h3 id="assessing-factors">Assessing Factors</h3>
<!-- todo - assessing factors section: this one takes threat into account. Which asks the question, do threats and powers need an introduction earlier. Like along with actions? That's part of the essence of the game. Also we want a good version of the magnitude chart up here with powers. -->
<p>To assess effect level, first start with your gut feeling, given this situation. Then, if needed, assess factors that may modify the effect level: <strong>potency</strong>, <strong>scale</strong>, and <strong>threat</strong>. If the PC has an advantage in a given factor, consider a higher effect level. If they have a disadvantage, consider a reduced effect level.</p>
<p>When considering factors, effect level might be reduced below limited, resulting in <strong>zero effect</strong>—or increased beyond great, resulting in an <strong>overwhelming effect</strong>.</p>
<p>Every factor won’t always apply to every situation. You don’t have to do an exact accounting every time, either. Use the factors to help you make a stronger judgment call—don’t feel beholden to them.</p>
<h4 id="potency">Potency</h4>
<p>The potency factor considers particular strengths and weaknesses; taking extra time or a bigger risk, or favorable power combinations. A fire power is more potent against defenses based entrely on ice.</p>
<h4 id="scale">Scale</h4>
<p>Scale represents the number of opponents, size of an area covered, scope of influence, etc. Larger scale can be an advantage or disadvantage depending on the situation. In battle, more people are better. When infiltrating, more people are a hindrance.</p>
<p>If a power or ability gives +1 effect, it comes into play <em>after</em> the GM has assessed the effect level. For example, if you ended up with zero effect, the +1 effect bonus from your <span class="game-term">Bodyguard</span> ability would bump them up to limited effect.</p>
<p>Also, remember that a PC can <strong>push themselves</strong> (take 2 stress) to get +1 effect on their action.</p>
<h4 id="threat-2">Threat</h4>
<p>Threat represents the quality and force of a power or character.</p>
<p><em>Thorn is fighting her way out of the safehouse of a gang of occult fantatics. Her plant attack power is threat 1, the Occult’s gang is threat 3. Thorn is seriously outclassed in threat, so she will have no effect unless she boosts the threat of her power somehow.</em></p>
<h3 id="trading-position-for-effect">Trading Position for Effect</h3>
<p>After factors are considered and the GM has announced the effect level, a player might want to trade position for effect, or vice versa. For instance, if they’re going to make a risky roll with standard effect (the most common scenario, generally), they might instead want to push their luck and make a desperate roll but with great effect.</p>
<p>This kind of trade-off isn’t included in the effect factors because it’s not an element the GM should assess when setting the effect level. Once the level is set, though, you can always offer the trade-off to the player if it makes sense in the situation.</p>
<p><em>“I <span class="game-term">Move</span> across the courtyard and vault over the wall, fading in the shadows by the canal dock and gondola.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I don’t think you can make it across in one quick dash. The scale of the courtyard is a factor here, so your effect will be limited. Let’s say you can get halfway across with this action, then you’ll have to <span class="game-term">Spy</span> through the other half of the space (and the rest of the guards there) to reach the other side.”</em></p>
<p><em>“I didn’t realize it was that far. Hmmm. Okay, what if I just go as fast as I can. Can I get all the way across if I make a desperate roll?”</em></p>
<p><em>“Yep, sounds good to me!”</em></p>
<h3 id="consequences">Consequences</h3>
<p>When a PC suffers an effect from an enemy, dangerous situation, or because of their power limits, it’s called a <strong>consequence</strong>. Consequences are the companion to effects. Heroes have effect on the world around them and they suffer consequences in return from the risks they face.</p>
<h2 id="setting-position-%26-effect">Setting Position &amp; Effect</h2>
<!-- this is the section for more about threat.  -->
<p>The GM sets position and effect for an action roll at the same time, after the player says what they’re doing and chooses their action. Usually, <strong>Risky / Standard</strong> is the default combination, modified by the action being used, the strength of the opposition, and the effect factors.</p>
<p>The ability to set position and effect as independent variables gives you nine combinations to choose from, to help you convey a wide array of fictional circumstances.</p>
<p>For example, if a character is facing off alone against a small enemy gang, the situation might be:</p>
<ul>
<li>She fights the gang straight up, rushing into their midst, hacking away in a wild <span class="game-term">Fight</span>. In this case, being threatened by the larger force lowers her position to indicate greater risk, and the scale of the gang reduces her effect <strong>(Desperate / Limited)</strong>.</li>
<li>She fights the gang from a choke-point, like a narrow alleyway where their numbers can’t overwhelm her at once. She’s not threatened by several at once, so her risk is similar to a one-on-one fight, but there’s still a lot of enemies to deal with, so her effect is reduced <strong>(Risky / Limited)</strong>.</li>
<li>She doesn’t fight the gang, instead trying to maneuver her way past them and escape. She’s still under threat from many enemy attacks, so her position is worse, but if the ground is open and the gang can’t easily corral her, then her effect for escaping isn’t reduced <strong>(Desperate / Standard)</strong>. If she had some immediate means of escape (like leaping onto a speeding truck), then her effect might even be increased <strong>(Desperate / Great)</strong>.</li>
<li>The gang isn’t aware of her yet—she’s set up in a sniper position on a nearby roof. She takes a shot against one of them. Their greater numbers aren’t a factor, so her effect isn’t reduced, and she’s not immediately in any danger <strong>(Controlled / Great)</strong>. Maybe instead she wants to fire off a salvo of suppressing fire against the whole gang, in which case their scale applies <strong>(Controlled / Limited)</strong>. If the gang is on guard for potential trouble, her position is more dangerous <strong>(Risky / Great)</strong>. If the gang is alerted to a sniper, then the effect may be reduced further, as they scatter and take cover <strong>(Risky / Limited)</strong>. If the gang is able to muster covering fire while they fall back to a safe position, then things are even worse for our hero <strong>(Desperate / Limited)</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="consequences-%26-harm">Consequences &amp; Harm</h2>
<p>Villain actions, bad circumstances, or the outcome of a roll can inflict <strong>consequences</strong> on a PC. There are five types (at right).</p>
<p>A given circumstance might result in one or more consequences, depending on the situation. The GM determines the consequences, following from the fiction and the style and tone established by the game group.</p>
<!-- somethin about power limit consequences  -->
<h3 id="reduced-effect">Reduced Effect</h3>
<p>This consequence represents impaired performance. The PC’s action isn’t as effective as they’d anticipated. You hit him, but it’s only a bruise. She accepts the forged invitation, but she’ll keep her eye on you throughout the night. You’re able to scale the wall, but it’s slow going—you’re only halfway up. This consequence essentially reduces the effect level of the PC’s action by one after all other factors are accounted for.</p>
<h3 id="complication">Complication</h3>
<p>This consequence represents trouble, mounting danger, or a new threat. The GM might introduce an immediate problem that results from the action right now: the room catches fire, you’re disarmed, the team looses status with police because of the chaos, you lose status with another organization, the target evades you and now it’s a chase, reinforcements arrive, the villains start taking hostages, etc.</p>
<p>Or the GM might tick a clock for the complication, instead. Maybe there’s a clock for the activation of the villain’s superweapon. Or maybe the GM creates a new clock for the suspicion of the elite guests at the masquerade party and ticks it. Fill one tick on a clock for a minor complication or two ticks for a standard complication.</p>
<p>A <strong>serious complication</strong> is more severe: reinforcements surround and trap you, the room catches fire and falling ceiling beams block the door, your weapon is broken, the team looses 2 status with the police, your target escapes out of sight, etc. Fill three ticks on a clock for a serious complication.</p>
<p><strong>Don’t inflict a complication that negates a successful roll.</strong> If a PC tries to corner an enemy and gets a <strong>4/5</strong>, don’t say that the enemy escapes. The player’s roll succeeded, so the enemy is cornered… maybe the PC has to wrestle them into position and during the scuffle the enemy grabs their gun.</p>
<h3 id="lost-opportunity">Lost Opportunity</h3>
<p>This consequence represents shifting circumstance. You had an opportunity to achieve your goal with this action, but it slips away. To try again, you need a new approach—usually a new form of action or a change in circumstances. Maybe you tried to <span class="game-term">Fight</span> with the ninja to trap her on the balcony, but she evades your maneuver and leaps out of reach. If you want to trap her now you’ll have to try another way—maybe by <span class="game-term">Swaying</span> her with your roguish charm.</p>
<h3 id="worse-position">Worse Position</h3>
<p>This consequence represents losing control of the situation—the action carries you into a more dangerous position. Perhaps you make the leap across to the next rooftop, only to end up dangling by your fingertips. You haven’t failed, but you haven’t succeeded yet, either. You can try again, re-rolling at the new, worse position. This is a good consequence to choose to show escalating action. A situation might go from controlled, to risky, to desperate as the action plays out and the PC gets deeper and deeper in trouble.</p>
<h3 id="harm">Harm</h3>
<p>This consequence represents a long-lasting debility (or death). When you suffer harm, record the specific injury on your character sheet equal to the level of harm you suffer. If you suffer <strong>lesser harm</strong>, record it in the bottom row. If you suffer <strong>moderate harm</strong>, write it in the middle row. If you suffer <strong>severe harm</strong>, record it in the top row. See examples of harm and the harm tracker, below.</p>
<p>Your character suffers the penalty indicated at the end of the row if any or all harm recorded in that row applies to the situation at hand. So, if you have <span class="game-term">Drained</span> and <span class="game-term">Battered</span> harm in the bottom row, you’ll suffer reduced effect when you try to run away from the constables. When you’re impaired by harm in the top row (severe harm, level 3), your character is incapacitated and can’t do anything unless you have help from someone else or <strong>push yourself</strong> to perform the action.</p>
<p>If you need to mark a harm level, but the row is already filled, the harm moves up to the next row above. So, if you suffered standard harm (level 2) but had no empty spaces in the second row, you’d have to record severe harm (level 3), instead. If you run out of spaces on the top row and need to mark harm there, your character suffers a <strong>catastrophic, permanent consequence</strong> (loss of a limb, sudden death, etc., depending on the circumstances).</p>
<!-- todo - Table from p27 -->
<aside class="left">
<h4 id="harm-examples">Harm examples</h4>
<p><strong>Fatal (4):</strong> <span class="game-term">Electrocuted</span>, <span class="game-term">Drowned</span>, <span class="game-term">Stabbed in the Heart</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Severe (3):</strong> <span class="game-term">Impaled</span>, <span class="game-term">Broken Leg</span>, <span class="game-term">Shot in Chest</span>, <span class="game-term">Badly Burned</span>, <span class="game-term">Terrified</span>.</p>
<p><strong>Moderate (2):</strong> <span class="game-term">Exhausted</span>, <span class="game-term">Deep Cut to Arm</span>, <span class="game-term">Concussion</span>, <span class="game-term">Panicked</span>, <span class="game-term">Seduced</span>.</p>

<p>Harm like <span class="game-term">Drained</span> or <span class="game-term">Exhausted</span> can be a good fallback consequence if there’s nothing else threatening a PC (like when they spend all night studying those old books, looking for any clues to their enemy’s weaknesses before he strikes).</p>
</aside>
<h2 id="resistance-and-armor">Resistance and Armor</h2>
<p>When your PC suffers a consequence that you don’t like, you can choose to resist it. Just tell the GM, “No, I don’t think so. I’m resisting that.” Resistance is always automatically effective—the GM will tell you if the consequence is reduced in severity or if you avoid it entirely. Then, you’ll make a <strong>resistance roll</strong> to see how much stress your character suffers as a result of their resistance.</p>
<p>You make the roll using one of your character’s <strong>attributes</strong> (<span class="game-term">Insight</span>, <span class="game-term">Prowess</span>, or <span class="game-term">Resolve</span>). The GM chooses the attribute, based on the nature of consequences:</p>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">Insight</span>: Consequences from deception or understanding.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Prowess</span>: Consequences from physical strain or injury.</li>
<li><span class="game-term">Resolve</span>: Consequences from mental strain or willpower.</li>
</ul>
<p>Your character suffers <strong>6 stress</strong> when they resist, <strong>minus the highest die result from the resistance roll</strong>. So, if you rolled a <strong>4</strong>, you’d suffer 2 stress. If you rolled a <strong>6</strong>, you’d suffer zero stress. If you get a <strong>critical</strong> result, you also <strong>clear 1 stress</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Ian’s character, Silas, is in a desperate <span class="game-term">Fight</span> with several sword demons and one of them lands a blow with their sword. Since the position was desperate, the GM inflicts severe harm (modified by any other factors). They tell Ian to record level 3 harm, “Gut Stabbed” on Silas’s sheet. Ian decides to resist the harm, instead. The GM says he can reduce the harm by one level if he resists it. Ian rolls 3d for Silas’s <span class="game-term">Prowess</span> attribute and gets a <strong>5</strong>. Silas takes 1 stress and the harm is reduced to level 2, <span class="game-term">Cut to the Ribs</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Usually a resistance roll means you <strong>avoid the consequence</strong>, or reduce it by a couple of steps. If you’re going to suffer fatal harm, for example, a resistance roll could reduce that to typical harm instead. Or if you got a complication and the GM was going to mark three ticks on a clock, she’d only mark one (or maybe none) if you resisted the complication.</p>
<p><strong>You may only roll against a given consequence once.</strong></p>
<!-- note -left off here -->
<p>The GM also has the option to rule that your character only <strong>reduces the severity</strong> of the consequence. For instance, maybe you’re in a sword fight and the consequence is getting disarmed. When you resist, the GM says that you avoid that consequence completely: you keep hold of your weapon.</p>
<p><strong>By adjusting which consequences are reduced vs. which are avoided, the GM establishes the overall tone of your game</strong>. For a more daring game, most consequences will be avoided. For a grittier game, most consequences will only be reduced with resistance.</p>
<p>The GM may also threaten several consequences at once, then the player may choose which ones to resist (and make rolls for each).</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“She stabs you and then leaps off the balcony. Level 2 harm and you lose the opportunity to catch her with fighting.”</p>
</blockquote>
<blockquote>
<p>“I’ll resist losing the opportunity by grappling her as she attacks. She can stab me, but I don’t want to let her escape.”</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Once you decide to resist a consequence and roll, you suffer the stress indicated. You can’t roll first and see how much stress you’ll take, then decide whether or not to resist.</p>
<p>todo - add table p29</p>
<h3 id="armor">Armor</h3>
<p>If you have a type of <strong>armor</strong> that applies to the situation, you can mark an armor box to reduce or avoid a consequence, instead of rolling to resist.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Silas is taking level 2 harm, “Cut to the Ribs,” and the fight isn’t even over yet, so Ian decides to use Silas’s armor to reduce the harm. He marks the armor box and the harm becomes level 1, “Bruised.” If Silas was wearing heavy armor, he could mark a second armor box and reduce the harm again, to zero.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When an armor box is marked, it can’t be used again until it’s restored. All of your armor is restored when you choose your <strong>load</strong> for the next score.</p>
<h3 id="death">Death</h3>
<p>There are a couple ways for a PC to die:</p>
<ul>
<li>If they suffer level 4 fatal harm and they don’t resist it, they die. <em>Sometimes this is a choice a player wants to make, because they feel like it wouldn’t make sense for the character to survive or it seems right for their character to die here.</em></li>
<li>If they need to record harm at level 3 and it’s already filled, they suffer a catastrophic consequence, which might mean sudden death (depending on the circumstances).</li>
</ul>
<p>When your character dies, you have options:</p>
<ul>
<li>You can create a new scoundrel to play. Maybe you “promote” one of the NPC gang members to a PC, or create a brand new character who joins the crew.</li>
</ul>
<h2 id="fortune-roll">Fortune Roll</h2>
<p>The fortune roll is a tool the GM can use to disclaim decision making. You use a fortune roll in two different ways:</p>
<p><strong>When you need to make a determination about a situation the PCs aren’t directly involved in</strong> and don’t want to simply decide the outcome.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Two rival gangs are fighting. How does that turn out? The GM makes a fortune roll for each of them. One gets a good result but the other gets limited effect. The GM decides that the first gang takes over some of their rivals’ turf but suffer some injuries during the skirmish.</p>
</blockquote>
<p><strong>When an outcome is uncertain</strong>, but no other roll applies to the situation at hand.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>While pilfering the workshop of an alchemist, Cross is possessed by a vengeful ghost. As control of his body slips away, Cross grabs a random potion bottle and drinks it down. Will the arcane concoction have an effect on the spirit? Will it poison Nock to death? Who knows? The GM makes a fortune roll to see how it turns out.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>When you make a fortune roll you may assess <strong>any trait rating</strong> to determine the dice pool of the roll.</p>
<ul>
<li>When a faction takes an action with uncertain outcome, you might use their <strong>Tier</strong> rating to make a fortune roll.</li>
<li>When a gang operates independently, use their <strong>quality</strong> rating for a fortune roll.</li>
<li>When a supernatural power manifests with uncertain results, you might use its <strong>magnitude</strong> for a fortune roll.</li>
<li>When a PC <strong>gathers information</strong>, you might make a fortune roll using their <strong>action rating</strong> to determine the amount of the info they get.</li>
</ul>
<p>If no trait applies, roll 1d for sheer luck or create a dice pool (from one to four) based on the situation at hand. If two parties are directly opposed, make a fortune roll for each side to see how they do, then assess the outcome of the situation by comparing their performance levels.</p>
<p>The fortune roll is also a good tool to help the GM manage all the various moving parts of the world. Sometimes a quick roll is enough to answer a question or inspire an idea for what might happen next.</p>
<p>Other examples of fortune rolls:</p>
<ul>
<li>The PCs instigate a war between two factions, then sit back and watch the fireworks. How does it turn out? Does either side dominate? Are they both made vulnerable by the conflict? Make a few fortune rolls to find out.</li>
<li>A strange sickness is sweeping the city. How badly is a crime ridden district hit by the outbreak? The GM assigns a magnitude to the arcane plague, and makes a fortune roll to judge the extent of its contamination.</li>
<li>The Hound stakes out a good spot and makes a sniper shot against a gang leader when he enters his office. The controlled <span class="game-term">Hunt</span> roll is a success, but is great effect enough to instantly kill a grizzled gang leader? Instead of making a progress clock for his mortality, the GM decides to use a simple fortune roll with his “toughness” as a trait to see if he can possibly survive the attack. The roll is a <span class="game-term">4/5</span>: the bullet misses his heart, but hits him in the lung—it’s a mortal wound. He’s on death’s door, with only hours to live, unless his gang can get an expert physicker to him in time.</li>
<li>Inspectors are putting a case together against the PC crew. How quickly will their evidence result in arrests? The crew’s <span class="game-term">wanted level</span> counts as a major advantage for the inspectors.</li>
<li>The PCs face off in a skirmish with a veteran demon hunter captain and her crew. The tide of battle goes in the PCs’ favor, and many crew members are killed. One of the players asks if the captain will surrender to spare the rest of her crew’s lives. The GM isn’t sure. How cold-hearted is this veteran hunter? She’s stared giant demons in the eye without flinching… is there anything human left inside her? The GM makes a 2d fortune roll for “human feelings” to see if a spark of compassion remains in heart. If so, maybe one of the PCs can roll to <span class="game-term">Consort</span>, <span class="game-term">Sway</span>, or <span class="game-term">Inspire</span> her to stand down.</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="gathering-information">Gathering Information</h2>
<p>The flow of information from the GM to the players about the fictional world is very important in a roleplaying game. By default, the GM tells the players what their characters perceive, suspect, and intuit. But there’s just too much going on to say <em>everything</em>—it would take forever and be boring, too. The players have a tool at their disposal to more fully investigate the fictional world.</p>
<p>When you want to know something specific about the fictional world, your character can <strong>gather information</strong>. The GM will ask you <strong>how</strong> your character gathers the info (or how they learned it in the past).</p>
<p>If it’s common knowledge, the GM will simply answer your questions. If there’s an obstacle to the discovery of the answer, an action roll is called for. If it’s not common knowledge but there’s no obstacle, a simple fortune roll determines the quality of the information you gather.</p>
<p>Each attempt to gather information takes time. If the situation allows, you can try again if you don’t initially get all the info that you want. But often, the opportunity is fleeting, and you’ll only get one chance to roll for that particular question.</p>
<p>Some example questions are on the bottom of the character sheet. The GM always answers honestly, but with a level of detail according to the level of effect.</p>
<p>The most common gather information actions are <span class="game-term">Surveying</span> the situation to reveal or anticipate what’s going on and <span class="game-term">Studying</span> a person to understand what they intend to do or what they’re really thinking.</p>
<p>Sometimes, you’ll have to maneuver yourself into position before you can gather information. For example, you might have to <span class="game-term">Prowl</span> to a good hiding place first and then <span class="game-term">Study</span> the cultists when they perform their dark ritual.</p>
<h3 id="investigation">Investigation</h3>
<p>Some questions are too complex to answer immediately with a single gather information roll. For instance, you might want to discover the network of contraband smuggling routes in the city. In these cases, the GM will tell you to start a <strong>long-term project</strong> that you work on during <strong>downtime</strong>.</p>
<p>You track the investigation project using a progress clock. Once the clock is filled, you have the evidence you need to ask several questions about the subject of your investigation as if you had great effect.</p>
<h3 id="examples-%26-questions">Examples &amp; Questions</h3>
<ul>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Attune</span> to see echoes of recent spirit activity. <em>Have any new ghosts been here? How can I find the spirit well that’s calling to them? What should I be worried about?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Menace</span> a local barkeep to tell you what he knows about the secret meetings held in his back room. <em>What’s really going on here? What’s he really feeling about this? Is he part of this secret group?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Consort</span> with a well-connected friend to learn secrets about an enemy, rival, or potential ally. <em>What do they intend to do? What might I suspect about their motives? How can I discover leverage to manipulate them?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Hunt</span> a courier across the city, to discover who’s receiving satchels of coin from a master duelsit. <em>Where does the package end up? How can I find out who signed for the package at City Hall?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Study</span> ancient and obscure books to discover an arcane secret. *How can I disable the runes of warding? *<em>Will anyone sense if they’re disabled?</em></li>
<li>Or you might <span class="game-term">Study</span> a person to read their intentions and feelings. <em>What are they really feeling? How could I get them to trust me?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Survey</span> a manor house to case it for a heist. <em>What’s a good point of infiltration? What’s the danger here?</em></li>
<li>Or you might <span class="game-term">Survey</span> a charged situation when you meet another gang. <em>What’s really going on here? Are they about to attack us?</em></li>
<li>You might <span class="game-term">Sway</span> a powerful lord at a party so he divulges his future plans. <em>What does he intend to do? How can I get him to think I might be a good partner in this venture?</em></li>
<li>Or you might <span class="game-term">Sway</span> his bodyguard to confide in you about recent events. <em>Where has he been lately? Who’s he been meeting with?</em></li>

<h2 id="relationships">Relationships</h2>
<!-- This section is for more indepth details about relationships.  -->
<h2 id="the-faction-game">The Faction Game</h2>
<h3 id="tier">Tier</h3>
<p>Each notable faction is ranked by <strong>Tier</strong>—a measure of wealth, influence, and scale. At the highest level are the Tier V and VI factions, the true powers of the city. Your crew begins at Tier 0.</p>
<p>You’ll use your Tier rating to roll dice when you acquire an asset, as well as for any fortune roll for which your crew’s overall power level and influence is the primary trait. Most importantly, your Tier determines the <strong>quality level</strong> of your items as well as the quality and <strong>scale</strong> of the gangs your crew employs—and thereby what size of enemy you can expect to handle.</p>
<h4 id="gang-scale-by-tier">Gang scale by tier</h4>
<ul>
<li><span class="game-term">tier v</span>. Massive gangs. (80 people)</li>
<li><span class="game-term">tier iv</span>. Huge gangs. (40 people)</li>
<li><span class="game-term">tier iii</span>. Large gangs. (20 people)</li>
<li><span class="game-term">tier ii</span>. Medium gangs. (12 people)</li>
<li><span class="game-term">tier i</span>. Small gangs. (3-6 people)</li>
<li><span class="game-term">tier 0</span>. 1 or 2 people</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="hold">Hold</h3>
<p>On the faction ladder next to the Tier numbers is a letter indicating the strength of each faction’s <strong>hold</strong>. Hold represents how well a faction can maintain their current position on the ladder. W indicates <strong>weak</strong> hold. S indicates <strong>strong</strong> hold. Your crew begins with <strong>strong</strong> hold at <strong>Tier 0</strong>.</p>
<h3 id="development">Development</h3>
<p>To move up the ladder and develop your crew, you need <span class="game-term">rep</span>. <span class="game-term">Rep</span> is a measure of clout and renown. When you accrue enough <span class="game-term">rep</span>, the other factions take you more seriously and you attract the support needed to develop and grow.</p>
<p>When you complete a score, your crew earns **2 <strong><span class="game-term">rep</span>. If the target of the score is higher Tier than your crew, you get <strong>+1 <strong><span class="game-term">rep</span></strong> per Tier higher</strong>. If the target of the score is lower Tier, you get <strong>-1 <span class="game-term">rep</span></strong> per Tier lower</strong> (minimum zero).</p>
<p>You need <strong>12 <span class="game-term">rep</span></strong> to fill the <span class="game-term">rep</span> tracker on your crew sheet. When you fill the tracker, do one of the following:</p>
<ul>
<li>If your hold is weak, it becomes strong. <strong>Reset your <strong><span class="game-term">rep</span></strong> to zero</strong>.</li>
<li>If your hold is strong, you can pay to increase your crew Tier by one. This costs <span class="game-term">coin</span> equal to your <strong>new Tier x 8</strong>. As long as your <span class="game-term">rep</span> tracker is full, you don’t earn new <span class="game-term">rep</span> (12 is the max). Once you pay and increase your Tier, <strong>reset your <strong><span class="game-term">rep</span></strong> to zero</strong> and <strong>reduce your hold to weak</strong>.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="turf">Turf</h3>
<p>Another way to contribute to the crew’s development is by acquiring <strong>turf</strong>. When you seize and hold territory, you establish a more stable basis for your <span class="game-term">rep</span>. Each piece of turf that you claim represents abstracted support for the crew (often a result of the fear you instill in the citizens on that turf).</p>
<p>Turf is marked on your <span class="game-term">rep</span> tracker (see the example below). Each piece of turf you hold reduces the <span class="game-term">rep</span> cost to develop by one. So, if you have 2 turf, you need 10 <span class="game-term">rep</span> to develop. If you have 4 turf, you need 8 <span class="game-term">rep</span> to develop. <strong>You can hold a maximum of 6 turf.</strong> When you develop and reset your <span class="game-term">rep</span>, <strong>you keep the marks from all the turf you hold.</strong></p>
<p>todo - table p37</p>
<p>Also, when you acquire turf, you expand the scope of your crew’s <strong>hunting grounds</strong>.</p>
<h4 id="reducing-hold">Reducing hold</h4>
<p>You may perform an operation specifically to reduce the hold of another faction, if you know how they’re vulnerable. If the operation succeeds, the target faction loses 1 level of hold. If their hold is weak and it drops, the faction loses 1 Tier and stays weak.</p>
<p>When a faction is at war, it temporarily loses 1 hold.</p>
<p>Your crew can lose hold, too, following the same rules above. If your crew is Tier 0, with weak hold, and you lose hold for any reason, your lair comes under threat by your enemies or by a faction seeking to profit from your misfortune.</p>
<h3 id="faction-status">Faction Status</h3>
<p>Your crew’s <strong>status</strong> with each faction indicates how well you are liked or hated. Status is rated from -3 to +3, with zero (neutral) being the default starting status. You track your status with each faction on the faction sheet.</p>
<p>When you create your crew, you assign some positive and negative status ratings to reflect recent history. The ratings will then change over time based on your actions in play.</p>
<h4 id="faction-status-changes">Faction status changes</h4>
<p>When you execute an operation, you gain -1 or -2 status with factions that are hurt by your actions. You may also gain +1 status with a faction that your operation helps. (If you keep your operation completely quiet then your status doesn’t change.) Your status may also change if you do a favor for a faction or if you refuse one of their demands.</p>
<h4 id="faction-status-levels">Faction status levels</h4>
<ul>
<li>**+3: <strong>Allies</strong>. This faction will help you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. They expect you to do the same for them.</li>
<li><strong>+2: <strong>Friendly</strong>.</strong> This faction will help you if it doesn’t create serious problems for them. They expect you to do the same.</li>
<li><strong>+1: <strong>Helpful</strong>.</strong> This faction will help you if it causes no problems or significant cost for them. They expect the same from you.</li>
<li>**0: <strong>Neutral</strong></li>
<li><strong>-1: <strong>Interfering</strong>.</strong> This faction will look for opportunities to cause trouble for you (or profit from your misfortune) as long as it causes no problems or significant cost for them. They expect the same from you.</li>
<li><strong>-2: <strong>Hostile</strong>.</strong> This faction will look for opportunities to hurt you as long as it doesn’t create serious problems for them. They expect you to do the same, and take precautions against you.</li>
<li><strong>-3: <strong>War</strong>.</strong> This faction will go out of its way to hurt you even if it’s not in their best interest to do so. They expect you to do the same, and take precautions against you. When you’re at war with any number of factions, your crew suffers +1 <span class="game-term">heat</span> from scores, temporarily loses 1 hold, and PCs get only one downtime action rather than two. You can end a war by eliminating your enemy or by negotiating a mutual agreement to establish a new status rating.</li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p>If your crew has weak hold when you go to war, the temporary loss of hold causes you to lose one Tier. When the war is over, restore your crew’s Tier back to its pre-war level.</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="claims">Claims</h3>
<p>Each crew sheet has a map of claims available to be seized. The claim map displays a default roadmap for your crew type. Claims should usually be seized in an orderly sequence, by following the paths from the central square, the crew’s lair.</p>
<p><em>However, you may attempt to seize any claim on your map</em>, ignoring the paths (or even seek out a special claim not on your map) but these operations will always be especially difficult and require exceptional efforts to discover and achieve.</p>
<h4 id="seizing-a-claim">Seizing a claim</h4>
<p>Every claim is already controlled by a faction. To acquire one for yourself, you have to take it from someone else. To seize a claim, tell the GM which claim on your map your crew intends to capture. The GM will detail the claim with a location and a description and will tell you which faction currently controls that claim. Or the GM might offer you a choice of a few options if they’re available.</p>
<p>If you choose to ignore the roadmap paths when seizing a claim, the GM might tell you that you’ll need to investigate and gather information in order to discover a claim of that type before you can attempt to seize it.</p>
<p>Execute the operation like any other <strong>score</strong>, and if you succeed, you seize the claim and the targeted faction loses the claim.</p>
<p>Seizing a claim is a serious attack on a faction, usually resulting in -2 faction status with the target, and potentially +1 status with its enemies.</p>
<p>As soon as you seize a claim, you enjoy the listed benefit for as long as you hold the claim. Some claims count as <strong>turf</strong>. Others provide special benefits to the crew, such as bonus dice in certain circumstances, extra <span class="game-term">coin</span> generated for the crew’s treasury, or new opportunities for action.</p>
<h4 id="losing-a-claim">Losing a claim</h4>
<p>An enemy faction may try to seize a claim that your crew holds. You can fight to defend it, or negotiate a deal with the faction, depending on the situation. If you lose a claim, you lose all the benefits of that claim. If your lair is lost, you lose the benefits of all of your claims until you can restore your lair or establish a new one. To restore or establish a new lair, accomplish a score to do so.</p>
<h2 id="advancement">Advancement</h2>
<h3 id="pc-advancement">PC Advancement</h3>
<p>Each player keeps track of the experience points (<strong>xp</strong>) that their character earns.</p>
<p>During the game session, mark xp:</p>
<ul>
<li>When you make a <strong>desperate action roll</strong>. Mark 1 xp in the attribute for the action you rolled. For example, if you roll a desperate <span class="game-term">Skirmish</span> action, you mark xp in <span class="game-term">Prowess</span><em>.</em> When you roll in a <strong>group action</strong> that’s desperate, you also mark xp.</li>
</ul>
<p>At the end of the session, review the <strong>xp triggers</strong> on your character sheet. For each one, mark 1 xp if it happened at all, or mark 2 xp if it happened a lot during the session. The xp triggers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your playbook-specific xp trigger</strong>. For example, the Cutter’s is <em>“Address a challenge with violence or coercion.”</em> To “address a challenge,” your character should attempt to overcome a tough obstacle or threat. It doesn’t matter if the action is successful or not. You get xp either way.</li>
<li><strong>You expressed your beliefs, drives, heritage, or background.</strong> Your character’s beliefs and drives are yours to define, session to session. Feel free to tell the group about them when you mark xp.</li>
<li><strong>You struggled with issues from your vice or traumas</strong>. Mark xp for this if your vice tempted you to some bad action or if a trauma condition caused you trouble. Simply indulging your vice doesn’t count as struggling with it (unless you <strong>overindulge</strong>).</li>
</ul>
<p>You may mark end-of-session xp on any xp tracks you want (any attribute or your playbook xp track).</p>
<p>When you fill an xp track, clear all the marks and take an <strong>advance</strong>. When you take an advance from your playbook track, you may choose an additional <strong>special ability</strong>. When you take an advance from an attribute, you may add an <strong>additional action dot</strong> to one of the actions under that attribute.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Nadja is playing a Hound. At the end of the session, she reviews her xp triggers and tells the group how much xp she’s getting. She rolled two desperate <span class="game-term">Hunt</span> actions during the session, so she marked 2 xp on her <span class="game-term">Insight</span> xp track. She addressed several challenges with tracking or violence, so she marks 2 xp for that. She expressed her Iruvian heritage many times when dealing with the Red Sashes, so she takes 2 xp for that. She also showcased her character’s beliefs, but 2 xp is the maximum for that category, so she doesn’t get any more. She didn’t struggle with her vice or traumas, so no xp there. That’s 4 xp at the end of the session. She decides to put it all in her <span class="game-term">Insight</span> xp track. This fills the track, so she adds a new action dot in <span class="game-term">Hunt</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>You can also earn xp by <strong>training</strong> during downtime. When you train, mark xp in one of your attributes or in your playbook. A given xp track can be trained only once per downtime phase.</p>
<h3 id="crew-advancement">Crew Advancement</h3>
<p>At the end of the session, review the crew xp triggers and mark 1 crew xp for each item that occurred during the session. If an item occurred multiple times or in a major way, mark 2 crew xp for it. The crew xp triggers are:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>Your crew-specific xp trigger</strong>. For example, the Smugglers’ is <em>“Execute a smuggling operation or acquire new clients or contraband sources.”</em> If the crew successfully completed an operation from this trigger, mark xp.</li>
<li><strong>Contend with challenges above your current station.</strong> If you tangled with higher Tiers or more dangerous opposition, mark xp for this.</li>
<li><strong>Bolster your crew’s reputation or develop a new one.</strong> Review your crew’s reputation. Did you do anything to promote it? Also mark xp if you developed a new reputation for the crew.</li>
<li><strong>Express the goals, drives, inner conflict, or essential nature of the crew.</strong> This one is very broad! Essentially, did anything happen that highlighted the specific elements that make your crew unique?</li>
</ul>
<p><strong>When you fill your crew advancement tracker</strong>, clear the marks and take a new **special ability **or mark <strong>two crew upgrade boxes</strong>.</p>
<blockquote>
<p>For example, when a crew of Assassins earns a crew advance, they could take a new special ability, like <strong>Predators</strong>. Or they could mark two upgrades, like <strong>Ironhook Contacts</strong> and <strong>Resolve</strong> <strong>Training</strong>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Say how you’ve obtained this new ability or upgrades for the crew. <em>Where did it come from? How does it become a new part of the crew?</em></p>
<h4 id="profits">Profits</h4>
<p>Every time the crew advances, <strong>each PC gets stash</strong> equal to the crew Tier+2, to represent profits generated by the crew as they’ve been operating.</p>
